# dotfiles
Trying to cleanup my mess

## Shell

Given apple is not shipping with zsh by default, why not?
ohmyzsh was a bit slow on my old machine, so I'll be using antibody

* z
* vi bindings
* git auto-complete that works with aliases

### Installation

Install Antibody: `brew install getantibody/tap/antibody`

Link what is needed:

```zsh
ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc
ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/.zsh/.zsh
```
